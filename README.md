# CaCuLocation
### A Hackathon Project for Coder Academy

Created by [Ash](https://github.com/Ash-Eileen) & [Nick](https://github.com/nick-ducker)

****

CaCuLocation was made by in under 3 days for a cross campus Coder Academy hackathon challenge.

CaCuLocation allows users to easily create, edit and share locations where it is possible to take succulent cuttings.
The application was built with Express, Mongo, Bootstrap & Mapbox.

Current features:
  * The app populates the map dynamically using data pulled from a remote mongoDB database
  * Users can add, edit and delete their own pins 
  * Users can geolocate themselves
  * App geocodes coordinates into objects and can also find addresses
  * App can geolocate with appropriate permissions
  * App will ensure the correct user is logged in before changing existing data
  * User page that collates all pins belonging to a particular user.

Future ideas include: 
  * Ability to add images to each pin
  * Each pin having its own page
  * Being able to search through pins/filter
  * Allowing users to leave comments on pins
